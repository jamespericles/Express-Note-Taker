### <a name="Description"></a>Description

This lightweight application allows for users to write and store notes to a server using heroku. All notes are stored server-side and is my first dive into backend web development.

### <a name="Installation"></a>Installation

If you choose to make edits to this application or to run it on a local server, I'd recommend running `npm i` within the root of the directory to download all necessary node modules. I was also using nodemon for my local server needs before deploying to heroku. If you aren't interested in making any changes, you can deploy it to heroku as well or wherever else you'd like to deploy to.

### <a name="Usage"></a>Usage

This is a very light weight note taking application as mentioned before. There aren't too many features that make it competitive with other note taking applications and was more so to help teach myself backend web development.
